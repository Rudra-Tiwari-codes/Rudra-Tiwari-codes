## About Me

I am a Data Science student at the University of Melbourne with a strong focus on building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My passion lies in bridging the gap between complex machine learning models and scalable software applications. I enjoy tackling challenging engineering problems, from optimizing deep learning inference pipelines to architecting full-stack web solutions.

## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to major open-source projects in the AI and software engineering ecosystem.
