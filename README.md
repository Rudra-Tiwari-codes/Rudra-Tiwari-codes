## About Me

I am a Data Science student at the University of Melbourne with a strong focus on building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My passion lies in bridging the gap between complex machine learning models and scalable software applications. I enjoy tackling challenging engineering problems, from optimizing deep learning inference pipelines to architecting full-stack web solutions.

## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to major open-source projects in the AI and software engineering ecosystem.

*   **LangChain**: Contributed to the core framework for building LLM applications. [View Merged PRs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+Rudra-Tiwari-codes)
*   **Captum (Meta PyTorch)**: Enhanced model interpretability tools. [View PR #1692](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/captum/pull/1692)
*   **HSF (High Energy Physics Software Foundation)**: Contributed to software used in high-energy physics research. [View Merged PRs](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+Rudra)
